-- CXX_EXTRA_FLAGS: 
        Appends to common compile flags. These will be appended at link phase as well.
        To use separate flags at link phase, set `CXX_EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS`
-- CXX_EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS: 
        Appends to link flags which appear *before* the objects.
        Do not use this for linking libraries, as the link line is order-dependent
-- CXX_EXTRA_LIBRARIES: 
        Append to link flags which appear *after* the objects.
        Use this for linking extra libraries (e.g `-lmylib`, or simply `mylib`)
-- CXX_EXTRA_LINKER_FLAGS: 
        Append to linker flags (i.e GCC's `-Wl` or equivalent)
-- Available models:  omp;ocl;std-indices;std-ranges;hip;cuda;kokkos;sycl;acc;raja;tbb;thrust
-- Selected model  :  sycl
-- Supported flags:

   CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER (optional, default=c++): Any CXX compiler that is supported by CMake detection, this is used for host compilation when required by the SYCL compiler
   SYCL_COMPILER (required): Compile using the specified SYCL compiler implementation
        Supported values are
           ONEAPI-ICPX  - icpx as a standalone compiler
           ONEAPI-Clang - oneAPI's Clang driver (enabled via `source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh  --include-intel-llvm`)
           DPCPP        - dpc++ as a standalone compiler (https://github.com/intel/llvm)
           HIPSYCL      - hipSYCL compiler (https://github.com/illuhad/hipSYCL)
           COMPUTECPP   - ComputeCpp compiler (https://developer.codeplay.com/products/computecpp/ce/home)
   SYCL_COMPILER_DIR (optional, default=): Absolute path to the selected SYCL compiler directory, most are packaged differently so set the path according to `SYCL_COMPILER`:
           ONEAPI-ICPX              - `icpx` must be used for OneAPI 2023 and later on releases (i.e `source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh` first)
           ONEAPI-Clang             - set to the directory that contains the Intel clang++ binary.
           HIPSYCL|DPCPP|COMPUTECPP - set to the root of the binary distribution that contains at least `bin/`, `include/`, and `lib/`
   OpenCL_LIBRARY (optional, default=): [ComputeCpp only] Path to OpenCL library, usually called libOpenCL.so
